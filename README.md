## 🌐 Deployment

This website is configured for automated deployment to Absolute Hosting via GitHub Actions.

### Automated Deployment Setup

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically deploys your website to Absolute Hosting whenever you push changes to the `main` branch.

#### Initial Setup Steps:

1. **Get FTP Credentials from Absolute Hosting:**
   - Log in to your Solid Control Panel at Absolute Hosting
   - Navigate to "Hosting Space Menu" → "FTP Accounts"
   - Create or note your FTP account username and password
   - Find your FTP server address (usually `ftp.yourdomain.co.za` or similar)

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret** and add:
     - `FTP_SERVER`: Your FTP server address (e.g., `ftp.yourdomain.co.za`)
     - `FTP_USERNAME`: Your FTP account username
     - `FTP_PASSWORD`: Your FTP account password

3. **Adjust Server Directory (if needed):**
   - Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - The default `server-dir` is set to `/public_html/`
   - If your hosting uses a different directory (like `/www/`, `/htdocs/`, etc.), update line 17

4. **Deploy:**
   - Push any change to the `main` branch, or
   - Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub and manually trigger the workflow

#### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually via FTP:
- Use an FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
- Upload all files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
